This module covers advanced topics in optical remote sensing and image analysis, including (but not necessarily limited to):

- photogrammetry
- digital elevation models and terrain analysis
- image processing and manipulation
- advanced classification techniques such as object-based image analysis
- time series analysis and change detection using Google Earth Engine.

In this module, students will develop an in-depth understanding of advanced remote sensing data and methods. The module will provide the necessary theoretical and practical knowledge of advanced
principles of remote sensing, and will equip students to use both proprietary and open-source software packages for advanced image analysis.

Material from current and past iterations of EGM702 can be found by following the links along the side of the page.
